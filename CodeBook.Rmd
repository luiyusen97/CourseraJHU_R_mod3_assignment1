# CodeBook

This is a codebook describing the variables, data and transformations performed on the raw data. For details on raw data, refer to readme and features_info text files in the rawdata folder.

## Variables

```{r, echo=FALSE}

dat_avg_values <- read.table(file = "output//dat_avg_values.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
activity_levels_char <- readLines(con = "output//activity_levels.txt")
close(con = "output//activity_levels.txt")
experimenttype_levels_char <- readLines(con = "output//experimenttype_levels")
close(con = "output//experimenttype_levels")
column_names <- colnames(dat_avg_values)
variable_explanation_table <- data.frame()
description_vector <- c("Variable used for grouping purposes.",
                        )

```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
